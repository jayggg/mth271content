    "A car-free bridge is still considered a ridiculous idea in many parts of our country (and some go so far as to call it un-American).  Portlanders beg to differ. Our newest bridge, the *Tilikum Crossing,* opened in 2015, and is highly multimodal,  allowing travel for pedestrians, bikes, electric scooters, trains, streetcars, and buses (but the modality of travel by personal car is missing). Bike lanes were not an afterthought, but rather an integral part of the bridge  design. We therefore expect to see a good amount of bike traffic on Tilikum.  \n",
